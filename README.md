# Chess-Engine-In-C

**Introduction**
This repo contains my implementation of a Chess Engine. It is still in progress, and the game analysis functions are in the progress of being optimized and built.

**Design**
- The board is initialized as 16 different bit-boards. These are used to track the current position of each different piece. We use bit-boards as they are more space effective and increase effieciency significantly.
